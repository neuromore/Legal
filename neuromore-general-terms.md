### 3 VIRTUAL CURRENCY.
3.1 The neuromore app may include a virtual currency named “neuronium” or items or services for use with our app (“Virtual Goods"). Virtual Goods includes, but is not limited to, experience and channel access. If you are over 18 years old you may be able to buy neuronium. Neuronium may also be earned for fulfilling certain challenges and tasks within the neuromore app. You agree that once purchased neuronium and Virtual Goods have no monetary value and can never be exchanged for real money, real goods or real services from us or anyone else. You may use neuronium to purchase the Virtual Goods again. You also agree that you will only obtain neuronium and/or Virtual Goods only from us, and not from any third party. You agree that neuronium and Virtual Goods are not transferrable to anyone else and you will not transfer or attempt to transfer any neuronium or Virtual Goods to anyone else.

3.2 You do not own Virtual Goods or neuronium but instead you purchase a limited personal revocable licence to use them - any balance of Virtual Goods or neuronium does not reflect any stored value.

3.3 You agree that all sales by us to you of neuronium and Virtual Goods are final and that we will not refund any transaction once it has been made. If you live in the European Union you have certain rights to withdraw from distance purchases; however, please note that when you purchase a licence to use Virtual Goods or neuronium from us, you acknowledge and agree that we will begin the provision of the Virtual Goods or neuronium to you promptly once your purchase is complete and therefore your right of withdrawal is lost at this point. For the purposes of this paragraph 1.3, a "purchase" is complete at the time our servers validate your purchase and the applicable Virtual Goods or neuronium are successfully credited to your account on our servers.

3.4 If you do not connect your neuromore account on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or otherwise linked to your personally identifiable information, we will not be able to restore any purchases to a different device if you lose that device or it is damaged. Accordingly, any risk of loss of Virtual Goods or neuronium on a device which is not connected in this way is transferred to you upon completion of the purchase as described in paragraph 1.3 above.

3.5 If you live in the European Union, we will provide you with a VAT invoice where we are required to do so by law or where requested by you. You agree that these invoices may be electronic in format.

3.6 We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any neuronium or Virtual Goods without any liability to you.

3.7 We may revise the pricing for Virtual Goods and neuronium offered through the Services at any time. We may limit the total amount of Virtual Goods or neuronium that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total amount of neuronium or Virtual Goods that may be held in your account in the aggregate. You are only allowed to purchase neuronium and Virtual Goods from us or our authorized partners through the Services, and not in any other way.

3.8 Depending on your platform, any Virtual Goods or neuronium purchased will be purchased from your platform provider and such purchase will be subject to their respective terms of service and user agreement. Please check usage rights for each purchase as these may differ from item to item. Unless otherwise shown, content available in any in-app store has the same age rating as the app.

3.9 Without limiting paragraph 1.4, if we suspend or terminate your account in accordance with these terms you will lose any neuronium and Virtual Goods that you may have and we will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you.

In no event shall the total aggregate liability of the protected entities to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract or tort, including, but not limited to, negligence or otherwise) arising from these Terms of use or your use of the Services exceed, in the aggregate, the amount, if any, paid by you to neuromore for your use of the Services during the previous 12 months or if greater $100.

## 13 ARBITRATION.
### 13.1 AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.
This section 13 is referred to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement.”  You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and neuromore, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the neuromore Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between you and neuromore, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.  Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against neuromore on your behalf.  You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and neuromore are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

### 13.2 PROHIBITION OF CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND NON-INDIVIDUALIZED RELIEF.  
YOU AND NEUROMORE AGREE THAT BOTH YOU AND NEUROMORE MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.  UNLESS BOTH YOU AND NEUROMORE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.  ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). 

### 13.3 PRE-ARBITRATION DISPUTE RESOLUTION.  
neuromore is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at contact@neuromore.co.  If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”).  The Notice to neuromore should be sent to the email address set forth in section 11.10 above (“Notice Address”).  The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.  If neuromore and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or neuromore may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by neuromore or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or neuromore is entitled.

### 13.4 ARBITRATION PROCEDURES.  
Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.  For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.  Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.  If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.  The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.  Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms and applicable law.  Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
Unless neuromore and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.  If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.  If your claim is for $10,000 or less, neuromore agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

### 13.5 COSTS OF ARBITRATION.  
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules. 

### 13.6 CONFIDENTIALITY.  
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

### 13.7 SEVERABILITY.  
Without limiting the severability provision of these Terms, if a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.  If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of this section 12 is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of the Agreement will continue to apply.

### 13.8 FUTURE CHANGES TO ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.  
Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, neuromore agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending neuromore written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and neuromore in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement.
